In general, when creating vectors, the number of vectors, elements inserted, and elements accessed can be impacted by several
factors such as the data structure used, the algorithm implemented, and the input size. To justify the creation of 58 number of vectors,
we must understand that we are creating a vector of stucts that stores State Name,number of eligible voter plus a vector of structs that contain the
number of red and blue votes for each district in a state.So we have two vectors that are nested and 4 different data variables.We use the readFile function 
to expand and store the data as necessary.We sue the stat function to access elements within the vectors to calculate gerrymandering.We use the readOut function to
the load we just saved in the vectors.We use the search function to check if data regarding a state is present.We use the plot function to show a histogram
of Red and blue votes in each district of a specific state.Plot and stat require us to acces both nested vectors while search and readOut require us to access
only one vector.
Vector is initiallized on line 226.This initializes both vectors since they are nested.On line 88 in readFile function we add data and therefore expand
vectors as the text file requires.
